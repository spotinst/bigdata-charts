      # Upstream chart has hook-delete-policy "hook-failed", causing re-installs of the chart to fail. Let's override it.
      # More info:
      # The sparkoperator service account is created as part of a pre-install hook. That means that it is not managed by the
      # release lifecycle, and is not removed when the chart is uninstalled. Furthermore, the hook deletion policy is set to
      # "hook-failed", meaning that the resource is only deleted if the hook failed during execution.
      # Put together, this means that install -> uninstall -> re-install will always fail since the service account already exists.
      # To fix this, we set the hook-delete-policy to before-hook-creation, causing the previous resource to be deleted before
      # a new hook is launched (and the resource is created again).

      # https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#hook-resources-are-not-managed-with-corresponding-releases
      # https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#hook-deletion-policies
      # The hook-failed delete policy was introduced to support deployment via Argo CD:
